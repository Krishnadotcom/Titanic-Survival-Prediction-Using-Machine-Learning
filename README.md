# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Predictive-Data-Analysis
Developed as part of an academic group project, this repository demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline â€” from data preprocessing and visualization to model training and evaluation. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is analyzed and modeled using Python and key ML libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.
